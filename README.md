A 'micro power solar engine' has been a goal since my introduction to BEAM Robotics.
I believe that if there wasn't one before, I there is one now. What I'm presenting to you looks very similar 
to one of the circuits found in Steven Bolt's web pages. As you will see, I made only minor changes to that design and not without help. 
My contributions have been to recognize the potential of the circuit , bread board and test it. 
The bottom line is that if you have a power source which will provide 2.5Vdc at 10uA this circuit should drive a pager motor. 
It turns on the motor at 2.3 to 2.5Vdc and switches off at 1.2 to 1.5Vdc.
